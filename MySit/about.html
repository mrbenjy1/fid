<h2>Accomplishments</h2> 
<p>  
<li><strong>Saving animals from dangerous situations:</strong> This includes rescuing dogs from natural disasters like hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires, as well as from situations of neglect, abuse, and abandonment. For instance, after Hurricane Milton, animal rescue teams developed proactive models to clear animal shelters before storms and rescue animals during and after the event, providing medical care and transport to safety.</li>  
<br>
<li><strong>Intervening in cruelty cases:</strong> Our rescue teams work with law enforcement to investigate and dismantle puppy mills, dogfighting rings, and other large-scale animal cruelty operations, rescuing hundreds of animals at a time. In one instance, a rescue team assisted officials in saving 275 dogs from a suspected dogfighting operation, believed to be the largest takedown in that state's history.</li> 
<br> 
<li><strong>Providing medical care and rehabilitation:</strong> Rescued dogs often require extensive medical treatment for injuries, illnesses, and the effects of neglect. Our rescue teams ensure they receive veterinary care, including vaccinations, spaying/neutering, and treatment for specific conditions. They also provide behavioral rehabilitation for dogs suffering from fear, anxiety, or trauma.</li> 
<br> 
<li><strong>Offering temporary shelter and foster care:</strong> Our rescue organizations provide safe temporary housing for dogs in their care, often relying on networks of foster homes. This allows dogs to recover in a comfortable environment while awaiting permanent adoption.</li>
